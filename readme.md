Note:

As from assignment https://gitlab.com/piyush_ck/front-end-developer/-/blob/main/README.md

I made this website using Tailwindcss not by bootstrap because bootstrap is not compatible for this webpage, it will take to much time to build fully responsive page and also bootstrap websites looks and feels similar, this website looks different and we have customize alot using css to make as per design. Firstly i have tried to make using bootstrap but it taking to much time and i'm jumping back and forth from html file to css. By using tailwindcss i also minimized the use of css but it is not possible with bootstrap 5.

Thank you!
